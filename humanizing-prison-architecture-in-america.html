            <h6>The Problem</h6>
            <h4>Overcrowding in U.S. Prisons</h4>
            <p>Overcrowding in American prisons has become a prominent issue that has consequentially developed from America’s high incarceration and recidivism rates. However current solutions being implemented to address these problems are ultimately unsustainable as they involve either building more prisons or adding more inmates to already overcapacitated prisons.</p>

        <article class="mobile-copy">
            <h6>Starting Point</h6>
            <h4>Norway as a Model</h4>
            <p>The project initially started from a video I saw on my Facebook feed, showing the stark differences between a typical American prison in contrast to Halden prison in Norway. I was in disbelief as to how such a luxurious prison could be possibly effective, but discovered that the Norwegian prison model, a system based off rehabilitating inmates, has a much lower recidivism and higher rehabilitation rate than American prisons do.</p>

        <h6>Initial Research</h6>
        <h4>Choosing a Model</h4>
        <p>Based off these findings, I started to research into other prison models and discovered that Nordic prisons, in general, share similar statistics and values as the Norwegian prisons. Nordic prisons have been such a success that they have actually reached the point where the lack of inmates have caused prisons to close down due to a lack of incoming prisoners. Rather than creating my own prison model or a new system based off the Norwegian model, I chose a real life success model to convince prison administrators that the Norwegian system could act as a plausible solution.</p>

        <h6>Research</h6>
        <h4>Architecture as a Solution</h4>
        <p>Although there are many factors that differ between American and Norwegian prisons, the prison environment is the biggest difference between the two. Based on this insight, I focused my research on prison architecture, narrowing the structure down into the two key areas inmates spend the majority of their time: the cell and the yard. From there, I broke each structure down in order to understand the key influencing areas, noting the problematic structures within American prisons and the rehabilitating structures in the Norwegian ones — structures that could possibly call forth a solution.</p>

        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <h4>Forming the Narrative Through a Print &amp; Interactive Piece</h4>
        <p>In order to advocate to administration divisions in American prisons, I chose a printed pamphlet and tablet piece to convey the information. The print piece gives users to view a quick overview of the information, whereas the tablet piece allows users to go through the information more in-depth. Both pieces follow a similar format, telling the story in a narrative broken into four parts:</p>
        <p>1. <span>Introduction:</span> Brief overview on how architectural design choices may influence inmates behaviours following their release.</p>
        <p>2. <span>Opening:</span> Highlights the overcrowding and recidivism problem in America.</p>
        <p>3. <span>Comparison:</span> Presents the Norwegian prison model as the solution to rebase the American model on through a comparison of prison statistics.</p>
        <p>4. <span>Solution:</span> Shows the differences between American and Norwegian prison design while showcasing the amount and type of influence design elements have on recidivism and rehabilitation. This section is meant to encourage administrators to choose elements within the Norwegian example to create or modify their own custom prison spaces within their budget ranges.</p>

        <h4>Initial Sketches &mdash; Making the Data Meaningful</h4>
        <p>Through my initial sketches, I explored possible charts and diagrams to format the datasets in an easily digestible way. Since the entire piece highlights the key differences through comparison data, I explored different data visualization sets and layouts to maximize effective communication. Through this process I was able to eliminate ineffective and confusing charts and clearly juxtapose the two models.</p>

        <h4>Previous Iterations</h4>
        <p>This stage allowed me to develop the idea explored the sketches to figure out what parts of the design was working and what wasn’t. Through multiple critiques and feedback, I learned how even the simplest visual element can connote different or multiple meanings in a single dataset — meanings that I do not intend to be conveyed.</p>

        <p>The printed pamphlet itself acted as a refined frame for me to base my tablet piece on. I wanted the information to flow in a similar way and I didn’t want the differences between the two to be so drastic that the two did not correlate with one another, so I played with ways that I could expand on the information that I had to sacrifice in the pamphlet piece due to the lack of space. Although the tablet is much smaller than the pamphlet since I had to contain the content in single screens, easy and intuitive user interactions to hide and reveal information was a key factor in the designing process.</p>

                <h6>05 / Recidivism &amp; Rehabilitation in Architecture</h6>
                <p>Whereas the large poster allowed the user to compare the info in four different ways with the four quadrants — Norway, America, the cells, and the yards, the small size of the tablet made the section challenging to translate from print to digital. Motion graphics were used to organize the data, breaking the screen in four quadrants using tap interactions to direct the user to one of the four comparisons.</p>

        <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
        <p>To take this piece forward, I would like to expand on the interactions in the interactive piece so that users can compare more data sets and manipulate it to view it in multiple ways. The 4 quadrant solution breakdown currently is static, but I would like the user to be able to tap problematic areas of the American cell and have the possible solution design from the Norwegian cell highlighted. It would also display a recidivism to rehabilitation bar that can be increased or reduced when user adds or subtracts design components from the cells to demonstrate the structure’s progress towards rehabilitation or recidivism. I thought that it would also be interesting if the user could toggle the data depending on the types of factors leading to recidivism or rehabilitation and by intensity type so that users can read the data on the areas that concern them the most.</p>
